A simple Elite Dangerous journal file polling application that reads events of interest back to you using the windows TTS engine.

Accepts a path via standard input, otherwise falls back to the default one (%HOMEPATH%\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\). Reads only from the latest log file.

Contains code by Michael Kropat, available in https://gist.github.com/mkropat/7550097 .
